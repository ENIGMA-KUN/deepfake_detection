        ### How to Play
        1. Click **New Question** to get a random image
        2. Examine the image carefully
        3. Click **Real** if you think it's authentic or **Fake** if you think it's manipulated
        4. See the result and the AI's analysis
        5. Continue to test your skills against the AI!
        
        ### Tips for Spotting Deepfakes
        - Look for inconsistent lighting and shadows
        - Check for unnatural blending around facial features
        - Watch for irregular or blurry textures
        - Pay attention to the eyes and teeth, which are often poorly rendered
        - Notice any asymmetry in facial features

        ## About DeepFake Detective
        
        DeepFake Detective is an advanced AI-powered system designed to detect manipulated facial images, commonly known as "deepfakes." Using state-of-the-art deep learning models, our system can identify subtle signs of manipulation that are often invisible to the human eye.
        
        ### Features
        
        - **High-Accuracy Detection**: Our model is trained on diverse deepfake techniques for reliable detection
        - **Detailed Analysis**: Get confidence scores and visual explanations of detection results
        - **Interactive Game Mode**: Test your ability to spot deepfakes against our AI
        
        ### How It Works
        
        DeepFake Detective uses a specialized Xception neural network architecture that has been trained on thousands of real and manipulated facial images. The model analyzes various aspects of the image, including:
        
        - Texture patterns and inconsistencies
        - Blending boundaries and artifacts
        - Noise distribution patterns
        - Facial feature coherence
        
        Our detector is specifically designed to identify artifacts introduced by various deepfake generation methods, including face-swapping, face reenactment, and GAN-generated faces.
        
        ### Educational Purpose
        
        This tool is created for educational and awareness purposes. As deepfake technology becomes more sophisticated and widespread, it's important for people to understand how to identify potentially manipulated content.
        
        ### Technologies Used
        
        - Python
        - PyTorch (Deep Learning)
        - OpenCV (Computer Vision)
        - Streamlit (Web Interface)
        - MTCNN (Face Detection)
        - Xception (Neural Network Architecture)
